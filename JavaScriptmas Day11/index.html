            <h1>India-Switzerland Relations</h1>
            <p>India and Switzerland have had good relations since ages and both have common interests in various fields.</p>
            <p>During the cold war era, India’s policy of Non-alignment and Switzerland’s traditional policy of neutrality has led to a close understanding between the two countries. In 1948, a Treaty of Friendship was concluded between both the countries. Both believe in the spirit of democracy and pluralism. From 1971 to 1976, Switzerland represented the interests of India over the dispute in Bangladesh.</p>
